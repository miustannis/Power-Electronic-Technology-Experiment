*** ERROR "ALG_SINGULAR_JACOBIAN" *** Singular Jacobian matrix.
Some possible causes for a singular Jacobian matrix:
- Model operating outside of its intended region of operation.
- Node/subsystem with no connection to the reference (floating).
- Current loops (voltage sources/inductors in parallel).
- Missing equation and/or missing variable reference.
